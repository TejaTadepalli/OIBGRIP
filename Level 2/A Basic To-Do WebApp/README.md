# Task 3: A Basic To-Do WebApp

Develop a basic to-do app that enables a user to add daily tasks.
<br>
The to-do web app must allow users to add new items to a list, and items added to a list must be visible. Also, a user can mark a task "complete" upon its completion, and these completed tasks must appear on a seperate list, say Completed Tasks.
<br>
You can also add a seperate section titled Pending Tasks that will list all the tasks that require completion. In such a case, the to-do list will be a union of Pending Tasks list and the Completed Tasks list. Irrespective of the list, the user must be able to delete or edit tasks from it.
<br>
To further increase the web app's complexity or make it more detailed, you can add the date and time when a task is added and/or completed.
